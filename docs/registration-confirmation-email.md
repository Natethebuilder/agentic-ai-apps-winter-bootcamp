# Registration confirmation email

**Status: not enabled yet.** The email needs send access to the bootcamp's shared mailbox. Until it is enabled, the website's success message tells registrants that their registration is confirmed and that a formal invitation will follow by email.

When registration is open (`"registration": 1` in `api/site-state.json`), every new registrant should receive a short confirmation email. In state 2 the API refuses submissions, so no email is sent.

The email is sent by the shared Power Automate flow `Agentic Winter Bootcamps Registration Upsert`, not by the website. The flow already receives the confirmed company email and has a Microsoft 365 connection, so no new secrets, app registrations or mail services are needed, and the API-to-flow contract does not change.

## Before you start

Ask the owner of the bootcamp mailbox, or an Exchange admin, to grant you **Send As** permission on it. If the bootcamp address is a Microsoft 365 group rather than a shared mailbox, ask for Send As on the group. Do not send from a personal mailbox.

## Add it to the flow

In the Foundry branch of the flow (the **Route foundry** condition, where `eventId` equals `foundry-agentic-development-winter-bootcamp`):

1. Directly under **Foundry response**, add a **Condition** and rename it `New foundry registration`. Because it comes after the response, an email failure can never change the `202` the API receives.
2. Set the condition to the expression `actions('Create_foundry_registration')?['status']` **is equal to** `Succeeded`. This is only true when a new row was created, because the create step is skipped on the update path. If the create step has a different name, use that name with spaces replaced by underscores.
3. In the condition's **True** branch, add **Office 365 Outlook → Send an email from a shared mailbox (V2)**. Set **Original Mailbox Address** to the bootcamp mailbox.
4. Set **To** to the `companyEmail` value from the trigger body (expression `triggerBody()?['companyEmail']`).
5. Set **Subject** and **Body** from the template below. Switch the body editor to code view (`</>`) before pasting the HTML.
6. Set **Importance** to `Normal`. Leave CC and BCC empty.
7. In the email step's **Settings**, turn on **Secure inputs** and **Secure outputs**, like the other steps that handle registration data.
8. Save. Then reload the designer page and check that `New foundry registration` and the email step are still under **Foundry response** before you test.

Do **not** add the email to the update path or the "existing event/email" path:

- The company email is not verified (it is typed twice, not confirmed by link). Sending only when a row is created means each address can receive at most one confirmation per event, so the form cannot be used to repeatedly email someone else.
- The existing-email path deliberately returns the same generic `202` as a new registration. Sending an email there would reveal that the address was already registered.

`https://aka.ms/FoundryBootcamp` currently redirects to the deck (`#/deck`). Point it at the website root if registrants should land on the website instead.

**Plain-text version** (for previews or a text-only alternative)

```text

## Verify

Test only with explicit approval, because each test creates a SharePoint row and sends a real email.

1. Submit a new registration with a mailbox you control: one row is created and one email arrives from the shared mailbox.
2. Submit again from the same browser with different sessions: the row updates and **no** second email arrives.
3. Submit the same email from another browser: the generic `202` is returned and **no** email arrives.
4. Check the flow run history: the email step's inputs and outputs are redacted.
5. Switch `api/site-state.json` to `"registration": 2` in a test deployment: the API returns `403` and the flow is never called.
